## **Exploring Essential JavaScript Concepts**

Today, I focused on some fundamental **ES6 and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts** in JavaScript that enhance code organization and efficiency. Here’s a quick overview of what I learned:

### **ES6 Classes**
> I explored **ES6 classes**, which provide a cleaner and more structured way to create objects and implement inheritance compared to traditional constructor functions.

### **Hoisting**
> I revised hoisting, where function declarations and `var` variables are moved to the top of their scope during execution, but `let` and `const` are not initialized until their declaration.

### **Static Methods**
> I learned about **static methods**, which belong to a class but are not accessible from instances. They are useful for utility functions that don't depend on object properties.

### **The `this` Keyword**
> I deepened my understanding of `this`, which dynamically refers to the calling context. I practiced how `this` behaves differently in arrow functions, event listeners, and class methods.

### **Private Properties Using Symbols**
> To create truly **private properties**, I used **Symbols**, which generate unique keys that are inaccessible from outside the class, ensuring data encapsulation.

### **Key Takeaway**
> Today’s session reinforced how **ES6 features** improve JavaScript’s readability and maintainability. Understanding **hoisting, static methods,** `this`, and **private properties** has strengthened my ability to write clean and efficient code.
