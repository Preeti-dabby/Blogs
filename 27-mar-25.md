## **Today's Progress on the MNTN Website – Enhancing Scroll Experience**

Today, I focused on improving the **scroll functionality** of the MNTN website to create a smoother and more dynamic user experience. I implemented smooth scrolling using the CSS property:

`scroll-behavior: smooth;`  
This helps in making the navigation between sections feel seamless and natural.

I also worked with pseudo-elements like `::before` to add styling effects and enhance the overall layout. These elements helped me create additional design layers without modifying the actual HTML structure.

To make the page more interactive, I used JavaScript’s window.addEventListener to detect scroll events and apply custom animations and effects as the user scrolls through the page. This allowed me to control elements dynamically based on their position in the viewport.
