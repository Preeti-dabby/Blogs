## **Building AI-Blogger — Routes, Middleware & Editor UI**

Today was a productive day working on the AI-Blogger project — a MERN stack web app designed to simplify and supercharge content creation using the power of AI.

**Backend Work: Routes & Middleware**

The first part of the day was spent refining the backend. I focused on setting up Express routes and integrating essential middleware. Here's a quick breakdown of what I implemented:
* Auth Middleware: I created middleware to handle token verification and route protection. This ensures that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints like creating or editing posts.
* Post Routes: I set up RESTful routes for blog posts — including endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts (/api/posts).
* User Routes: Added basic user routes for registration, login, and profile management.

**Frontend Progress: Editor UI**

On the frontend, I worked on the editor page UI using React. This page is the core of the blogging experience, where users will write and edit their content — possibly enhanced with AI-generated suggestions. Key highlights:
* Modern, clean layout inspired by minimal writing tools.
* Integrated a rich text editor.
* Basic structure ready for integrating AI-assist features.
