### **Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Implementing Win Logic & Game Controls**

Today, I made significant progress in my **Tic-Tac-Toe** game by adding the *winning* logic in JavaScript and implementing game control buttons.

**What I Accomplished Today**

**Winning Logic in JavaScript :**

* Defined all possible winning combinations.
* Created a function to check if a player has won after every move.
* Displayed a message when a player wins.

**Game Control Buttons :**

* **New Game Button:** Starts a fresh game without refreshing the page.
* **Reset Game Button:** Clears the board and resets everything.

**Next Steps**

* improve UI for better user experience.
* add logic to display a message when the game ends in a draw.

Excited to refine the game further! ðŸš€
