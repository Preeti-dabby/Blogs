## **Today's Learning: Practicing React.js Fundamentals**

Today, I deepened my understanding of React.js by creating a simple static page from scratch. It was a hands-on session where I not only read about core React concepts but also implemented them in a mini practice project.
Hereâ€™s what I focused on:
* **Custom Components:** I created multiple reusable components to understand how React encourages modular UI development.
* **Fragments:** Learned how to return multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM using `<React.Fragment>` or `<> </>`.
* **ReactDOM.createRoot & root.render:** Set up the entry point of my app and rendered my main component inside the root element.
* **React Facts Markup:** Built a basic layout displaying facts about React using JSX and proper component structuring.

It was a productive day of experimenting and getting comfortable with the building blocks of React.
Looking forward to learning about hooks and dynamic data handling next!
