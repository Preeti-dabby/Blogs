## **Exploring Figma: Basics & Prototyping**

Today, I explored the basics of **Figma** and learned essential design and prototyping techniques. Hereâ€™s a quick summary of what I covered:

**Input Fields**
> I learned how to design **input fields** with proper spacing, borders, and text alignment for user-friendly forms.

**Using Component Instances & Overrides**
> Component instances allow me to **reuse and modify UI elements** without affecting the main component, making design updates more efficient.

**Editing Existing Components**
> I practiced tweaking **existing components** to customize layouts while maintaining design consistency.

**Prototyping in Figma**
> I explored **interactive prototypes**, linking screens and adding transitions for a smooth user experience.

**Sharing a Prototype**
> I learned how to **share prototypes** with team members and stakeholders for feedback and collaboration.

**Using Photoshop in Figma**
> I discovered how to **import and edit Photoshop files** in Figma, making it easier to work with existing assets.

**Mockups & Micro-Interactions**
> I created **mockups** to visualize UI layouts and experimented with **micro-interactions** to add subtle animations for a polished feel.
