## **Daily Progress Blog — [7-April-2025]**

Today, I focused on improving the front page of my project, specifically working on the **parallax effect** and **responsiveness** of the elements like the mountains, clouds, and the man.

I tried different approaches to make the design align properly and move smoothly together without overlapping. I adjusted CSS properties and experimented with JavaScript values, such as controlling the `style.top` and trying out `transform: translateY()` for better parallax control.

Despite my efforts, I faced challenges with responsiveness — whenever I adjusted positions or values, the design elements would misalign, and the responsiveness was not working as expected across different screen sizes.

Additionally, I noticed that the changes were not reflecting properly on GitHub Pages. I will continue debugging this issue to ensure my updates appear correctly online.

I will keep working on resolving these issues and improving the layout further in the next session!
