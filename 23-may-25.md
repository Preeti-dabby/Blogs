## **Today's Progress on AI-Blogger: Onboarding Steps Implementation**

Today was a productive day working on AI-Blogger, as I focused on building and integrating the onboarding steps feature. This functionality is crucial to our platform, as it allows users to input structured information before generating their blogs using AI.

The onboarding form captures key inputs from the user—such as the blog title, reference content, purpose, and tone. These fields guide the AI in generating content that aligns with the user’s intent and preferred style.

Once the user fills out these onboarding steps, the data is saved to the backend using our API. This structured input is then passed to the AI model as part of the prompt, ensuring that the generated blog content is relevant, coherent, and tailored to the user’s needs.

This marks an important step in making AI-Blogger more user-friendly and intelligent, bridging the gap between human intent and machine-generated creativity.
