## **Designing Authentication Pages with React and Tailwind CSS**

**What I Worked On**

Today, I focused on building the Login and Signup pages for my application. While it might sound straightforward, it involved learning and applying a range of new skills. I worked with ReactJS to structure the frontend and used Tailwind CSS to quickly style the components. My goal was to not only create functional pages but also build them with clean, reusable code in mind.

**Learning ReactJS in Practice**

React’s component-based architecture really started to make sense today. I broke down the UI into small, reusable pieces like `InputField` and `Button` components. This helped avoid repetition and made the codebase more manageable. I used `useState` to manage form inputs and passed props to components to keep them flexible. The dynamic nature of React made it easy to scale the UI and test changes in real time.

**Styling with Tailwind CSS**

Tailwind CSS proved to be a huge productivity booster. I used utility classes to build responsive and consistent layouts without writing a separate CSS file. Components were styled directly in JSX using classes like `p-4`, `rounded-md`, `shadow`, and `hover:bg-blue-600`. It was also easier to maintain visual consistency across both pages, since everything was based on a shared design system of utility classes.

**Building Reusable Components**

One of the key things I did today was create reusable UI components:
* **InputField:** A single component that works for all text and password inputs, customizable through props.
* **Button:** A flexible button that can be reused across different parts of the app with consistent styles and behaviors.
These components helped reduce code duplication and will be easy to maintain or extend later.

**Key Takeaways**

* Reusability is powerful—small components can simplify the entire UI.
* Tailwind’s utility-first approach complements React well for quick prototyping.
* Structuring forms may seem basic but requires thoughtful planning to ensure scalability and clean code.
* I now have a solid frontend base ready for backend integration and form validation.
