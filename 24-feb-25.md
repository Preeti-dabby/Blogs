## **Today's JavaScript Learning: Mastering Prototypes and Object Properties** 

Today, I focused on understanding the core concept of prototypes in JavaScript and how they influence object behavior and inheritance. Here's a breakdown of what I learned:

### **Prototypes in JavaScript**

I explored how every JavaScript object has a prototype, which acts as a blueprint from which it can inherit properties and methods. This forms the foundation of JavaScript’s inheritance system.

### **Property Attributes**

I learned about the three key property attributes that define how an object property behaves:
* **writable** – Controls whether a property’s value can be changed.
* **enumerable** – Determines if the property shows up in loops like `for...in`.
* **configurable** – Allows the property to be deleted or modified.

### **Constructor Prototypes**

I discovered how methods defined on a constructor’s prototype are shared across all instances, making memory usage more efficient.

### **Prototype vs. Instance Members**

I understood the difference between:
* **Instance members** – Unique to each object instance (defined inside the constructor).
* **Prototype members** – Shared across all instances (defined on the constructor’s prototype).

### **Iterating Properties**

While iterating over object properties, I learned to use `for...in` carefully since it loops through both own and inherited properties. Using `hasOwnProperty()` helps filter only the instance-specific properties.

### **Avoid Extending Built-in Objects**

A key best practice I picked up today: Avoid extending built-in JavaScript objects (like `Array.prototype` or `Object.prototype`). Doing so can lead to unexpected behavior and conflicts with future JavaScript updates or third-party libraries.
