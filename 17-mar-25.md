## **Today's Progress: HTML & CSS Research + Navbar Styling**

Designing the website is a bit challenging, but Iâ€™m pushing myself to learn everything needed to make it work. Today, I explored various **HTML & CSS** properties to enhance the websiteâ€™s design. My research covered Flexbox, Grid, CSS variables, transitions, typography, and box shadows to improve layout and styling.

I also worked on **styling the navbar**, focusing on positioning, hover effects, background styles.Itâ€™s not easy, but Iâ€™m determined to conquer every challenge and create a great design.

On to the next stepâ€”learning, improving, and building! ðŸš€
