### **Daily Blog: Refining the MNTN Landing Page**

Today’s focus was all about precision and improvement. I spent time carefully comparing my version of the MNTN website landing page with the original one. The goal was to spot all the differences—big or small—and make adjustments to match the original design as closely as possible.

I looked into layout alignment, font styles, spacing, image positioning, and even small details like button styles and animations. This process helped me understand how polished and well-balanced the original site is, and what I needed to tweak to reach that level.

By the end of the day, I managed to implement many of the necessary changes and improve the overall look and feel of my landing page. While it’s not a perfect match yet, it’s much closer to the original now. I’ll continue refining it, but I’m glad to see real progress taking shape.
