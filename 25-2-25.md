## **Revisiting JavaScript Fundamentals: A Quick Recap**

Today was all about revising the essential JavaScript concepts I’ve learned so far. Revisiting these foundational topics helped solidify my understanding and highlighted how they all connect. Here's a brief overview:

### **Objects**

I refreshed my knowledge of **objects** as collections of key-value pairs used to represent real-world entities. I also revisited different ways to create objects, including **object literals** and **factory functions**.

### **Functions**

I revised both **function declarations** and **expressions**. This also included revisiting concepts like **hoisting**, **default parameters**, and using **arrow functions** for cleaner syntax.

### **Constructors**

I went over **constructor functions**, which are used to create multiple instances of similar objects efficiently. I also practiced using the `new` keyword to instantiate objects.

### **Prototypes**

Lastly, I refreshed my understanding of **prototypes**—JavaScript’s built-in mechanism for inheritance. I revised how methods attached to a constructor’s prototype are shared among instances, making memory usage more efficient.

### **Key Takeaway**

Revisiting these core JavaScript concepts reinforced my understanding of how objects, functions, constructors, and prototypes work together.
