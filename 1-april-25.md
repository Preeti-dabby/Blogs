## **Website Progress Update: Almost There!**

Today, I wrapped up the core development of webpage using HTML and CSS. The structure is in place, the styling is implemented, and the overall design is looking great! It’s satisfying to see everything coming together after all the effort put into building it.

### **What’s Left to Do?**
*  **Responsiveness:** I still need to fine-tune the layout so it looks perfect across all screen sizes—desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* **Design Enhancements:** A few refinements are needed to make the page more visually appealing, like improving spacing, typography, and animations.

### **Final Thoughts**
Completing the frontend has been an exciting and challenging journey. Each day, I’ve learned something new—whether it’s working with CSS properties like `z-index`, `position`, `overflow`, and `flexbox`, or understanding how to structure content effectively.

Once these final touches are done, the webpage will be fully ready. Looking forward to the final version!
