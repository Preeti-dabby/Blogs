## **Today's Progress: Building the Frontend – Landing Page, Dashboard & Sidebar Component**

Today was a productive day in my development journey as I focused on crafting some key parts of the frontend for my project. Here’s a breakdown of what I accomplished:

### **What I Worked On**

1. **Landing Page UI**

I started the day by designing and building the Landing Page – the first impression of the app. My focus was on making it visually appealing and welcoming for new users. It currently includes:
* A clean and modern layout
* Call-to-action elements for onboarding
* Responsive design elements for a smooth experience across devices

This sets a solid foundation for the user’s entry point into the app.

2. **Dashboard Page UI**

Next, I moved on to the Dashboard Page, which will serve as the central hub for users after logging in. Today’s work included:
* Setting up the basic structure of the dashboard
* Creating placeholders for widgets and upcoming data displays
* Ensuring the layout is clean and scalable for future functionality

The goal was to get the skeleton right before diving into data integration later.

3. **Collapsible Sidebar Menu Component**

A big win for the day was building a Reusable Sidebar Menu Component that’s both collapsible and importable across pages.
* Collapsible: The sidebar can toggle between expanded and collapsed states, improving UX and conserving screen space.
* Modular: I built it as a standalone component, so it can be easily imported and reused in different layouts (like the dashboard or admin panels).
