## **Creating a Content Card Using Flex and Grid**

Today, I worked on designing one of the content cards for my project. I used **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** to structure the layout, ensuring a visually appealing design. The challenge was to balance flexibility and alignment while maintaining a clean look.

I applied **CSS styling** to the **count** and the **text**, making sure they stood out with proper spacing, font sizes, and colors. The count had a bold appearance, while the text had a refined, readable style. Using Grid for overall structure and Flexbox for inner alignment helped me achieve the perfect balance between design and functionality.

This was a small but important step in the project, and Iâ€™m excited to refine it further as I continue working on other elements!
