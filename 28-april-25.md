## **Today's Journey: Beginning My React.js Learning**

Today marks a new chapter in my web development journey â€” I started learning React.js!
I spent time understanding the basics of React and how it differs from traditional JavaScript development.

I explored key concepts like:
* **Components:** How React breaks the UI into small, reusable pieces.
* **JSX:** Writing HTML inside JavaScript, which felt strange at first but very powerful once I got used to it.
* **Props and State:** How data flows inside a React app and how components can be dynamic and interactive.
* **Functional Components:** I learned how simple functions can create powerful UI elements.

Setting up my first React project was exciting, and running the first "Hello World" through React made me realize how efficient and modern this framework is.
I'm looking forward to diving deeper into hooks and routing soon.
