## **Slow Progress but Productive Learning**

Today’s work was all about designing the other content card for the MNTN website. While the task itself was exciting, the process turned out to be much slower than expected due to my mobile data’s sluggish speed. Since my Wi-Fi was still down, I had no choice but to rely on it, making every step—from searching resources to testing the design—take longer than usual.

Despite the slow internet, I managed to make progress. I explored various HTML and CSS tags to enhance the content cards and improve their structure.

While designing, I also looked into different styling techniques to ensure the content cards matched the overall aesthetic of the MNTN website. I experimented with typography, spacing, and color combinations to maintain a clean and modern look.

Though the slow internet tested my patience, it also gave me time to deep dive into details I might have otherwise rushed through. By the end of the day, I had a better understanding of how to structure and style content cards efficiently.

This experience reinforced an important lesson: even when things don’t go as planned, there’s always something to learn. Every small step counts, and sometimes, slower progress means better attention to detail.
