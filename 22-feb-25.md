## **Today's JavaScript Learnings: Diving Deeper into OOP Concepts**

Today was all about strengthening my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript with some advanced concepts and hands-on practice. Here's a quick summary of what I explored:

**Private Properties & Methods**

I learned how to create private properties and methods, ensuring that certain data remains hidden and accessible only within the class.

**Getters & Setters**

These special methods allow controlled access and modification of private properties, making data management inside objects more flexible and secure.

**Stopwatch Exercise with Getters & Setters**

I put my new knowledge into practice by creating a functional **stopwatch** using **getters** and **setters** to manage the state and display of the timer effectively. This helped me understand real-world applications of these concepts.

**Inheritance**

I explored the difference between:
* **Classical Inheritance**– Common in languages like Java, using classes and constructors.
* **Prototypical Inheritance** – JavaScript’s native approach, where objects inherit directly from other objects.
* **Multilevel Inheritance** – An object inherits from another object, which inherits from yet another object, creating a chain of inheritance.
