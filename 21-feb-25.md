## **Diving into Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript** 

Today, I explored the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in JavaScript and how it differs from traditional **procedural programming**. While procedural programming focuses on step-by-step instructions, OOP organizes code around **objects**—bundling data and related functionality together for better structure and reusability.

**The 4 Pillars of OOP**

1. **Encapsulation** – Groups data and related methods into objects, protecting the internal state.
2. **Abstraction** – Hides the complexity and only exposes essential parts of the object.
3. **Inheritance** – Allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
4. **Polymorphism** – Enables objects to take multiple forms, typically by method overriding or extending functionality.

**Benefits of OOP**

* Promotes code reusability
* Simplifies maintenance and debugging
* Enhances scalability for larger applications

**JavaScript Object Concepts I Learned**

* **Object Literals** – Creating objects using key-value pairs directly.
* **Factory Functions** – Functions designed to return new object instances.
* **Constructor Functions** – A blueprint for creating objects using the new keyword.
* **Functions as Objects** – In JavaScript, functions themselves are objects with properties and methods.
* **Enumerating Properties** – Listing object properties using loops like for...in or Object.keys().
* **Abstraction** – Hiding implementation details while exposing necessary functionality.
