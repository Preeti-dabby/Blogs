## **Today's Progress: Diving into MongoDB and Backend Authentication**

Today was a productive day in my development journey. I focused primarily on backend development and deepened my understanding of MongoDB. It was my first time seriously working with this NoSQL database, and I explored how collections, documents, and schemas work together to structure and store data efficiently.

In addition to database learning, I also made good progress with setting up authentication in the backend using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. This involved creating user login and registration routes, hashing passwords securely, and issuing tokens upon successful authentication. I implemented middleware to protect certain routes and ensure that only authenticated users can access them.

It was a solid day of learning and building — I’m getting more comfortable with backend logic and excited to keep integrating more features.
