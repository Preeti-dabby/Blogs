## **Diving Deeper into ES6 Classes and Modules** 

Today, I explored advanced **ES6 class concepts** and got introduced to **ES6 modules**, which are essential for writing clean and scalable JavaScript code. Hereâ€™s a summary of what I learned:

### **Private Properties Using WeakMaps**
> I learned how **WeakMaps** can be used to create truly private properties in ES6 classes, ensuring data encapsulation while keeping properties inaccessible from outside the class.

### **Getters and Setters**
> I practiced using **getters and setters** to control access to object properties, allowing encapsulation and validation while retrieving or modifying values.

### **Inheritance and Method Overriding in ES6 Classes**
> I explored how **class inheritance** allows child classes to extend parent functionality and how **method overriding** enables a subclass to redefine inherited methods for custom behavior.

### **Introduction to ES6 Modules**
> I got introduced to **ES6 modules**, which help in writing **modular and maintainable** code by allowing exports and imports between different JavaScript files.

### **Key Takeaway**
> Understanding private properties, getters/setters, inheritance, method overriding, and ES6 modules has strengthened my ability to write structured and efficient JavaScript code.
