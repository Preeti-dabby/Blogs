## **Exploring Advanced JavaScript Concepts**

Today, I dived deeper into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in JavaScript, focusing on key principles that enhance code flexibility and reusability. Hereâ€™s what I learned:

**Method Overriding**

I explored how a **child class** can redefine a method from its **parent class**, allowing for customized behavior while maintaining the same method signature.

**Polymorphism**

I understood how different objects can **share the same method name** but implement it differently, making the code more adaptable and reducing duplication.

**When to Use Inheritance**

I explored best practices for **using inheritance**, understanding that it should be applied when multiple objects share common behavior, but should be used cautiously to avoid deep inheritance chains.

**JavaScript Mixins**

Mixins provide a way to **reuse code across multiple objects** without requiring strict class-based inheritance, making them useful for adding functionalities dynamically.

**Key Takeaway**

Today's session helped me understand when and how to use inheritance, method overriding, polymorphism, and mixins effectively. These concepts are crucial for writing scalable and maintainable JavaScript applications.
