##  **Expanding the UI: Frontend Development for Additional Pages**

Today was dedicated to expanding the frontend of my application. After setting up the Login and Signup pages earlier, I moved on to building the remaining UI pages. This included creating structured layouts, reusable components, and making the overall interface more cohesive.

**Component-Driven Approach**

To keep my code clean and efficient, I reused and expanded on components I built earlier:
* **Layout Wrapper:** A shared layout component that wraps all pages, containing common elements like headers or sidebars.
* **Cards, Headings, and Input Groups:** Modular components created to maintain a consistent UI pattern.
* Used **React Router** to link between pages and support dynamic navigation.

This helped streamline development and will make it much easier to implement logic later on.

**Styling with Tailwind CSS**

Tailwind CSS once again made styling fast and consistent. I focused on:
* Flex and Grid layouts for organizing page sections.
* Hover and focus states to improve interactivity.

I also experimented with some spacing, padding, and text utilities to improve the visual hierarchy.

**Key Takeaways**

* Building multiple pages with shared components speeds up development and improves maintainability.
* Tailwind continues to be a reliable tool for quick and consistent UI styling.
* The frontend structure is now ready to be connected with backend logic and real data.
