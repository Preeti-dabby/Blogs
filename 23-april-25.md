## **WhatsApp Web UI Clone – Completed Today!**

Today I wrapped up my WhatsApp Web UI clone, and I’m super excited about how it turned out!

**What I Completed:**
* Built a collapsible sidebar with all navigation icons (Chats, Calls, Status, etc.).

* Designed a fully functional left panel with multiple chat previews.

* Added a clean search bar with styling and shadow effects.

* Polished the layout to closely resemble the real WhatsApp Web.

* Ensured hover effects, scroll styling, and layout spacing match the real WhatsApp Web look.

It was a great hands-on session with HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Super happy with the result!
