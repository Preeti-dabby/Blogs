## **Today's Learning in React.js: Components, Props, JSX & More** 

Today was another step forward in my React.js journey. I focused on some of the essential building blocks that make React powerful and flexible for web development.
Here’s what I explored and practiced:
* **Parent and Child Components:** Learned how to structure apps by nesting components and passing data between them.
* **`export default:`** Understood how to export components properly so they can be reused throughout the app.
* **JSX:** Got hands-on with JSX syntax — writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript and understanding how it compiles under the hood.
* **Styling**: Practiced different styling approaches in React, including inline styles and using external CSS files.
* **Props:** Learned how to pass dynamic data to child components using props and how they help make components reusable and dynamic.
