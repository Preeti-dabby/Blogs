## **Daily Blog: Refining the MNTN Landing Page**

Today, I focused on narrowing the gap between my version of the MNTN website landing page and the original. I carefully compared both versions to spot design and layout differences, aiming to make my page as close to the original as possible.

I experimented with changing the viewport sizes to see how the layout behaves across different screen widths. Additionally, I tried adjusting the `style.top` values in JavaScript to fine-tune the positioning of elements. However, despite my efforts, I wasn’t able to fully achieve the desired effect with these methods.

Still, I managed to make several improvements and bring my version closer to the original design. I’ll keep exploring other solutions to fix the remaining issues and continue refining the page!
