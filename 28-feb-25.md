## **Deep Dive into JavaScript Inheritance**

Today, I explored more advanced concepts of **prototypical inheritance** in JavaScript, focusing on how objects inherit properties and methods efficiently. Here’s a quick summary of what I learned:

**Creating Custom Prototypical Inheritance**

I practiced manually setting up **prototypical inheritance** by linking an object’s prototype to another object using `Object.create()`, allowing shared methods across instances.

**Resetting the Constructor**

After modifying an object's prototype, I learned to **reset the constructor property** to ensure instances correctly reference their original constructor function.

**Calling the Super Constructor**

When inheriting from a parent constructor, I used the `call()` method inside the child constructor to invoke the parent constructor and initialize inherited properties.

**Intermediate Function Inheritance**

To properly set up inheritance, I used an **intermediate function** to establish the prototype chain without directly instantiating the parent object, preventing unnecessary memory usage.

**Key Takeaway**

Understanding prototypical inheritance and its best practices has given me a deeper insight into how JavaScript handles object-oriented programming.
