## **Enhancing AI-Blogger: Implementing Private Routes and Streamlining Button Management**

Today’s development session on AI-Blogger was all about securing the user experience and improving consistency across the app. I focused on two main tasks:

**Implementing Private Routes**

To ensure that only authenticated users can access sensitive parts of the application (like the dashboard or blog editor), I introduced Private Routes. This update is crucial for protecting user data and maintaining a secure workflow. Here’s a quick overview of what I did:
* Created a PrivateRoute component that checks if a user is authenticated.
* Wrapped all protected routes (e.g., /dashboard, /create-blog) with the PrivateRoute component.
* Redirected unauthenticated users to the login page if they try to access private routes.

**Managing Buttons Across the Website**

The second part of the day was spent refining the button components used throughout the site. Until now, various pages used slightly different implementations, which led to inconsistencies in behavior and styling. Today’s changes included:
* Centralizing the button component into a reusable Button.jsx.
* Replacing all scattered button styles with the unified component across pages like login, onboarding, and blog creation.
