## **Today's Work Summary: Fixing UI Issues, Midterm Hustle & Learning Responsiveness**

Today was all about refining the small but important details in my project. I focused on fixing minor UI issues to make the website look more polished and well-structured. Some of the key improvements I made included:
* **Image Alignment:** Adjusted positioning to ensure images were centered properly.
* **Text Alignment:** Fixed text placement to remove unnecessary gaps and improve consistency.
* **Opacity Adjustments:** Tweaked text opacity for better readability while maintaining the design aesthetics.
* **Margins & Paddings:** Fine-tuned spacing around elements to enhance the overall layout and user experience.

In addition to these refinements, I also spent some time watching **tutorials on making webpages responsive**. Since responsiveness is a crucial aspect of web design, I wanted to gain a better understanding of media queries, flexible layouts, and best practices for mobile-friendly designs.          
Along with all this, I had to manage **my midterm viva and report submission**, which took up about two hours of my day. Balancing work, studies, and learning something new was a challenge, but I made steady progress.              
Even though today's work mostly involved small tweaks, these little details make a big difference in the overall look and feel of a project. Excited to apply my learnings on responsiveness soon!
