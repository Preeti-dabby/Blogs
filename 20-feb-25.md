## **Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Mission Accomplished!**

After days of coding and refining, I have finally completed my **Tic-Tac-Toe** game using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**! 

**What I Accomplished Today :**

* **Implemented the Winning Logic** – Now, the game correctly detects a winner based on predefined patterns.
* **Added a Draw Condition** – If all boxes are filled without a winner, the game announces a draw.
* **Created "New Game" & "Reset" Buttons** – Players can restart the game anytime with a clean slate.
*  **Styled X and O with Different Colors**– X appears in red, and O in blue, enhancing the user experience.

**Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned**

* Ensuring the **game stops after a winner** was tricky, but careful conditional checks solved it.
* Managing state correctly helped in **resetting the board properly** without lingering issues.
* **Event listeners** and **DOM manipulation** proved essential in making the game interactive.

This project was a fun learning experience that reinforced my JavaScript skills.
