## **Designing the Footer of the MNTN Website**

Today, I started working on the MNTN website, and instead of designing the header or main sections first, I chose to begin with the footer. This might not be the usual approach, but for me, it felt more convenient. The footer is an essential part of any website, and getting it right early on helps maintain consistency in design.

The design was a bit challenging, mainly because I wanted to achieve a clean, modern look that matched the MNTN brand. The footer consists of three sections: the brand introduction on the left, useful blog links in the center, and company-related links on the right. I used **HTML** to structure the content and **CSS** Flexbox to align everything neatly. The dark background, gold highlights, and elegant typography brought the design to life.

Although this was just a small part of the overall project, completing it gave me a sense of accomplishment. It also set a foundation for the rest of the design, ensuring I maintain a consistent aesthetic. Next, Iâ€™ll be working on the header and main sections, but starting with the footer made my workflow smoother.
