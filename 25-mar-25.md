## **Designing the First Page of the MNTN Website – My Progress**

Today, I focused on designing the first page of the MNTN website, incorporating a **parallax** scrolling effect to enhance the visual appeal. One of the key challenges was **overlapping images** to create a smooth and natural look. I experimented with different approaches, adjusting the positioning and layering to ensure they blended well. Since this was a bit tricky, I watched multiple tutorials to better understand how to refine the effect and improve my implementation.

Alongside the main page, I also worked on the navbar design. I used several important CSS properties, such as:

* **z-index** to control the stacking order of elements,
* **overflow: hidden** to ensure clean positioning,
* Various **positioning techniques** to achieve the desired layout.

This project has been a great learning experience, allowing me to explore new CSS concepts and experiment with different styling techniques. While there’s still room for improvement. Looking forward to refining the design even further in the coming days!
