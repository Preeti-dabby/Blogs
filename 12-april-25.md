## **Project Update: Designing the Left-Side Chat Boxes for WhatsApp Clone**

Today, I continued building my WhatsApp Web clone, focusing specifically on designing the left-side chat section — the heart of WhatsApp, where all conversations are listed.
The goal was to make the chat boxes look clean, organized, and as close as possible to the actual WhatsApp Web interface. Step by step, I’ve been replicating the details to make the UI feel familiar and smooth!

**What I Worked On Today**
1. **Structured the Chat List Layout**
* Created the container for the chat list and ensured it fits seamlessly below the sidebar header.

* Made the list scrollable, just like WhatsApp Web, so users can easily scroll through multiple chats.
2. **Designed Individual Chat Boxes**
* Contact name in bold for visibility.
* Last message preview for quick context.
* Used flexbox to align everything neatly inside each chat box.
3. **Added Spacing and Visual Hierarchy**
* Added proper spacing between chat boxes to avoid clutter.
* Used subtle hover effects to mimic the WhatsApp feel when you hover over a chat.
4. **Polished Visuals**
* Maintained a clean design with consistent fonts, colors, and icon sizes.
* Ensured all profile pictures remain perfectly rounded and well-fitted.
