## **MNTN Website Responsiveness**

Today, I worked extensively on the responsiveness of the MNTN website, focusing on making it adaptable to different screen sizes. My goal was to ensure a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices while maintaining the clean and immersive design of the site.

**Challenges with the Landing Page**

The biggest challenge was handling the large background images used on the landing page. Since the website incorporates a parallax scrolling effect, resizing these images for mobile screens without breaking the layout proved to be tricky.

While the design looks perfect on the web, mobile responsiveness still needs some fine-tuning. The images `.hg`, `.mg`, and .`vg` were scrolling horizontally, which caused layout misalignment

**What I Accomplished Today**
* **Navbar Responsiveness** – On smaller screens, only the MNTN logo and Account option remain visible.
* **Prevented Image Overflow** – Adjusted CSS properties to stop horizontal scrolling issues.
* **Optimized Content Alignment** – Ensured that all sections, except for the landing page, are fully responsive.
*  **Completed the Landing Page for Desktop View** – It looks clean and structured, but I still need to tweak it for mobile screens.

**Final Thoughts**

With today’s work, I can confidently say that the MNTN website responsiveness is completed. The desktop view is perfect, and most of the mobile view is well-optimized, aside from some constraints due to the parallax effect.
