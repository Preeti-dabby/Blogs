## **Today's Development Log â€“ Blog Database, Draft Routes, and UI**

Today, I focused on enhancing the AI-Blogger application by working on the backend and frontend related to blog management.

**MongoDB Blog Database**

The first task involved structuring and storing blog data in MongoDB. Each blog now gets a unique ObjectID upon creation, ensuring reliable referencing and secure routing for individual blog entries.
* Created the blogs collection schema.
* Fields included: title, content, status (draft/published), author, and coverImage.
* Implemented MongoDB operations like create, update, read using Mongoose.

**API Routes for Blog Drafts**

I created dedicated Express.js routes to handle:
* Fetching all draft blogs by user ID.
* Updating a specific draft blog.
* Publishing a draft to make it live.

**Drafts Page UI**

On the frontend, I designed and implemented the Drafts Page:
* Users can see all their unpublished blog drafts in a clean UI.
* Each draft can be edited or published directly.
* Used React with `axios` for API calls and state management.
