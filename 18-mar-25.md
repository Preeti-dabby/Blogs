## **Today's Learning: Inspecting MNTN's Website Code**

Today, I took a deep dive into MNTN's website using the browser's **Inspect** tool. My goal was to understand the code structure and style properties that make up their design.

By analyzing the **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, I got insights into their layout, typography, animations, and responsiveness. Observing how elements are styled and structured gave me a better understanding of modern web design techniques and best practices.

This hands-on approach reinforced the importance of reverse-engineering well-designed websites to learn new tricks and improve coding skills. Excited to apply these insights in future projects!
