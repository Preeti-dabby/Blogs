## **Learning and Progress: Improving Text Positioning on the MNTN Website**

Today, I focused on adding text to the front page of the MNTN website. While this might seem like a simple task, I faced several positioning challenges while aligning the text with the background images and overall design. However, with patience and continuous learning, I was able to make improvements and understand better ways to position text in CSS.

### **Challenges Faced**

One of the main issues I encountered was aligning text correctly with the images. Sometimes, the text was overlapping in the wrong places, and other times, it wasnâ€™t positioned as expected. I experimented with various CSS properties like:
* `position: absolute;` and `position: relative;` for text placement
* `z-index` to ensure text appeared on top of images
* `text-align`, `line-height`, and `letter-spacing `for better readability
*  `flexbox` and `grid` for proper alignment

While I know I am still learning and things are moving slowly, I am gaining confidence every day. Each challenge I face teaches me something new, and step by step, I can see myself improving.

### **What I Learned Today**

* The importance of **text contrast** for better visibility over images
* How to use **CSS positioning techniques**effectively
* The role of **padding and margin** in text alignment
* How **z-index** ensures elements are layered correctly

I will continue refining the front page design and work on improving responsiveness and layout structure. With each passing day, I am learning new CSS tricks and best practices, and I am excited to apply them to enhance the website further!
